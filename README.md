# PadLayout
Custom ViewGroup that lays out child views with equal distance.

## About
Same design could be handled by nesting LinearLayouts. 
However, PadLayout can considerably improve that hierarchy into something more efficient.
Other custom views can be built simply by using this Custom ViewGroup such as Dialpad.

### Installation

Add the following to your `build.gradle`'s dependencies section:
```
implementation 'io.github.ali-rezaei:padLayout:1.0.0'
```
